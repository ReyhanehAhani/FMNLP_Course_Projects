# Image Captioning with BLIP

## Objective
The purpose of this code is to perform image captioning using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model. The code goes through various steps, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Data Acquisition

#### 1.1. Downloading FlickrStyle Dataset
```bash
!wget https://zhegan27.github.io/Papers/FlickrStyle_v0.9.zip
```

#### 1.2. Downloading Flickr Image Dataset
```bash
!kaggle datasets download -d hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing

#### 2.1. Extracting Humor and Romantic Descriptions
```python
# Reading funny and romantic descriptions
```

#### 2.2. Creating a Dictionary
```python
# Creating a dictionary (image_dict)
```

#### 2.3. Writing Data to CSV
```python
# Writing data to a CSV file (output.csv)
```

### 3. Additional Data Processing

#### 3.1. Reading Additional Results
```python
# Reading additional results from CSV file (results.csv)
```

#### 3.2. Merging Datasets
```python
# Merging datasets and creating output CSV files
```

### 4. Image Copying

#### 4.1. Copying Images
```python
# Copying images based on CSV information
```

### 5. Image Counting

#### 5.1. Counting Files
```python
# Counting files in a specified folder
```

### 6. Model Fine-Tuning

#### 6.1. Loading Model and Tokenizer
```python
# Loading BLIP model and tokenizer
```

#### 6.2. Fine-Tuning
```python
# Fine-tuning the model with provided data and optimizer
```

### 7. Evaluation

#### 7.1. Metrics Calculation
```python
# Calculating BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics
```

#### 7.2. Summary Table
```python
# Displaying a summary table of evaluation results
```

## Notes

### 8. Dependencies
Ensure that all required libraries such as Pandas, NLTK, Transformers, etc., are installed before running the code.

### 9. Environment
The code is designed to run in a Colab environment (google.colab is used for file upload and manipulation).

### 10. File Adjustments
Image filenames in the CSV file are adjusted for consistency (e.g., removing the prefix 'V').

### 11. Instructions for Running
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Run the code in a Colab environment or a suitable Python environment with the necessary permissions.
3. Monitor the training progress using TensorBoard if needed.
4. Review the evaluation metrics and adjust the model or parameters accordingly.

### 12. Disclaimer
The code assumes the availability of the specified datasets and files. This README provides a high-level overview, and users are encouraged to review the code comments and outputs for more details. Additional adjustments or modifications may be required based on specific use cases or environments.
